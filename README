Bio-Draw-FeatureStack version 0.02
==================================

FeatureStack creates GD images of vertically stacked gene models to facilitate visual comparison
of gene structures. Compared genes can be clusters of orthologous genes,
gene family members, or any other genes of interest. FeatureStack takes an array of BioPerl
feature objects as input, projects them onto a common coordinate space, flips features 
from the negative strand (optional), left-aligns them by start coordinates (optional), sets a 
fixed intron size (optional), removes unwanted transcripts (optional), and then draws the 
so transformed features with a user-specified glyph. Internally, this transformation is
achieved by cloning all input features into Bio::Graphics::Feature objects before the
features get rendered by the specified glyph. Output images can be generated in SVG 
(scalable vectorized image) or PNG (rastered image) format.
